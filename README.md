# Picorv32-SOC Design -using-Open-source-tools

WorkShop is focused on understanding the concepts involved in SOC design, 
from RTL to GDSII using Open Source tools based on 180nm PDK .
It helps us to gain concepts of PD flow practically ,some key take aways 
from this workshop are basic understanding to Open Source tools, IC terminologies ,
RISCV, Floorplanning , PDk's , SPICE simulations,CMOS 16 mask fabrication process ,
CTS ,Routing ,STA, DRC .
